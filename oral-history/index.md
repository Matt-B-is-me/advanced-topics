## Indigenous Rights to Anything: Quebec

The underlying pleas and calls for help in the audio clip come from a livestream of an indigenous woman, Joyce Echaquan, in Quebec, who had begun streaming her trips to Joliette hospital as a way of documenting her experiences, she had expressed concerns for her safety and was not fluent in French. This was also not the first time concerns had been raised: in the same CBC [interview]( https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-oct-1-2020-1.5745953/thursday-october-1-2020-full-transcript-1.5747401) that offered the translated statement of Echaquan’s widower, her cousin Alice speaks of the Manawan community’s experience “a lot of my partner, my sister, my brother live the same thing that lived Joyce, you know”. Alexia Nequado, from Manawan as well, corroborated Alice’s statement, [recounting](https://internewscast.com/racism-at-quebec-hospital-reported-long-before-troubling-death-of-atikamekw-woman/) an experience at Joliette where she was admitted for stomach pain two years prior to Joyce’s death. After calling a nurse Alexia was administered morphine, despite the allergy bracelet on her wrist stating she was allergic to morphine, and once she regained consciousness was berated for not advising the nurse.
As alarming as this may seem, it is also not a new occurrence, in 2015 , following  Trudeau’s inauguration and promise to open a national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women, allegations of police abuse from 2002-2015 was publicly broadcast on October 22, 2015\([page11](https://www.cerp.gouv.qc.ca/fileadmin/Fichiers_clients/Rapport/Final_report)\). Immediately following, an inquiry began with the findings, released in September 2019, stating it impossible to deny systemic discrimination toward indigenous peoples in Quebec, with the inquiry supplying 142 Calls for Action, but come May 2020 and [17 police officers and the canine unit intervene in Cabot Square to arrest a Quebec Native Woman](https://www.faq-qnw.org/en/news/qnw-denounces-a-police-intervention-toward-a-first-nations-woman/), and, as heard, come September 2020 exactly one year from publication of the inquiry, a woman died screaming in [Joliette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Joyce_Echaquan).

## Indigenous Rights to Anything: Protection

The RCMP’s function, for over a century, was for the cultural genocide of indigenous peoples in Canada\([Honouring the Truth and Reconciling for the Future, page 1](http://www.trc.ca/assets/pdf/Honouring_the_Truth_Reconciling_for_the_Future_July_23_2015.pdf)\), and yet no major changes have been wrought. Aside from prevalent sexual assault crises, the RCMP is continually discriminatory, and is used as a mechanism to enforce colonial rule. This assertion rests on a comparison between two cases, the first is the current violence and unrest surrounding Indigenous fisheries in Nova Scotia. Police can be seen standing by and failing to prevent the destruction of property in [this]( https://www.aptnnews.ca/national-news/van-torched-lobsters-destroyed-as-mob-surrounds-mikmaw-lobster-pounds-in-nova-scotia/) video clip compiled by the National News, gathered from social media. The video also shows instances of whites confronting indigenous and inhibiting their access to lobster pounds, and another live-streamed portion of an indigenous man trapped in a pound surrounded by protesters where the police recommended he stay inside shown in [this]( https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/10/14/mikmaq-chief-slams-nova-scotia-fishery-violence-they-are-getting-away-with-these-terrorist-hate-crime-acts.html). Another [video](https://www.facebook.com/M1KMAQ/videos/10159578885578968/?extid=eQf779rNc2SripRZ&d=n) shows Indigenous fisherman attempting to dock their boat while fares are shot at them from the coast. The RCMP has been called out for their inaction but has yet to assist in the confrontations. Conversely, earlier in 2020 the RCMP were used to disband peaceful protests blocking the Coastal Gaslink pipeline, and [80 individuals](https://thenarwhal.ca/in-photos-wetsuweten-matriarchs-arrested-as-rcmp-enforce-coastal-gaslink-pipeline-injunction/#:~:text=Members%20of%20the%20RCMP%20arrested,for%20the%20Coastal%20GasLink%20pipeline.) have been arrested thus far. The court ordered injunction also resulted in the RCMP spending more than [CAD 13 Million](https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/rcmp-wetsuweten-pipeline-policing-costs-1.5769555) to police Wet'suwet'en territory, territory that is unceded land. The discrepancy is staggering and an obvious showcase for Canada’s colonialism: the country still functions as a resource extraction site, and takes advantage of the indigenous communities for profit, or ultimately fails to protect them. In the same controversy, Coastal Gaslink documents were leaked, showing provisions that indigenous communities lead by the signee’s of the document (in this case indigenous leaders) were not allowed to post to social [media]( https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/coastal-gaslink-nak-azdli-whut-en-agreement-1.5238220). In a similar vein, according to the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Report the government of Canada has declared they would provide CAD9.6 million over five years to the RCMP’s new National Investigative Standards and Practices Unit, and a \‘ significant proportion\’ of the NISPU will focus on MMIWG\([76](https://www.mmiwg-ffada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Final_Report_Vol_1a-1.pdf)\). The report itself is filled with extensive firsthand accounts of the abuses suffered either by the hands of the RCMP, or the RCMP’s failure to protect. 

## Indigenous Rights to Anything: Anything

Aboriginal people in Canada have seen growth and support, however how much growth has there actually been? Instances like Joyce Echaquan’s death are not infrequent. The aboriginals themselves are especially vulnerable to abuse and the government has failed them and continues to – the calls to action from both the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls National Inquiry, and the calls to action from the Viens Commission have both been either ignored or inadequately addressed. The Inquiry advises the federal government has not done enough, Premier Legault [denied](https://montreal.citynews.ca/video/2020/10/07/premier-denies-that-systemic-racism-exists-in-quebec/) the presence of systemic racism in Quebec, and one last final [report](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2020/5/5/pipelines-man-camps-and-murdered-indigenous-women-in-canada) featuring an interview with an indigenous woman in Alberta and her escape from sexual exploitation. There is not only failure to correct, but the continued repression seems to fly in the face of Prime Minister Trudeau’s words.
