## Manchuria’s Strategic Value
The newly founded People’s Republic of China (PRC hereafter) had not only just resolved a decades long civil war fought against the Kuomintang (KMT hereafter) government but was still recovering from the near decade long Japanese occupation. The map displays points of interest here; <a href="javascript:locateMapFeature(projectMap._layers[51]._layers[1])">*Manchuria*</a> (an approximate rendering as the province was disbanded, but roughly accurate) was the industrial centre of China and had been occupied by Japan since 1932. As the industrial centre [Source](https://doi.org/10.2307/3022242) major railways spread from Manchuria into most of southern China, and this is what the Japanese used as logistical support in invading China, thus the over-reaching Japanese Occupation section of the map. The railways themselves were under constant attention by both the KMT and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA hereafter) due to their logistic value. Strategically, both keeping armies easily supplied with food, soldiers, weaponry etc., and keeping troops highly mobile is inherently valuable, and this is how the Manchurian railroads were used. Once Japan began expanding its occupation, it followed the major railways through southern China eventually coming to control the majority [Source](https://www.britannica.com/event/Second-Sino-Japanese-War).

## The Chinese Communist Party and North Korea
During the latter stages of the Chinese Civil War (fought between the KMT and the PRC), the PLA established a base in Manchuria. In late 1946 the KMT forces invaded south Manchuria and approximately 18,000 PLA troops, their families, and wounded combatants retreated to North Korea [Source](https://doi-org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/10.4324/9781315673288). The North Korean government itself provided relief areas within North Korea for the Communist Party (hereafter CCP). Additionally, volunteers from the Korean People’s Army supplemented the PLA forces, and the North Korean government provided logistical support to the PLA. During the following Japanese withdrawal from the Korean peninsula and China, the KMT government did nothing to prevent local ethnic Chinese in Manchuria raiding and damaging Korean populations in Manchuria and North Korea, thus when the CCP lead local revolts against the KMT Koreans participated and provided support. The raids themselves were a result of preferential treatment given to Korean farmers during Japanese occupation [Source](https://doi-org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/10.4324/9781315673288).

## The Chinese Communist Party and the United States of America
The U.S. invested heavily in the nationalist KMT government during the Chinese civil war, providing troops, training, and weaponry to use against the CCP, which ultimately prolonged the war [Source](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2131236576/A25AF28A3A604769PQ/7?accountid=14771). The total investment added up to more than US$ 2 Billion [Source](https://www.jstor.org/stable/654064). The two parties were opposed from 1927 – 1937 with a respite during the War of Resistance against Japan and resumed following the Japanese surrender, coming to an end in 1949 with the CCP as the victors [Source](https://www.britannica.com/event/Chinese-Civil-War). The CCP sought to eradicate the KMT, who began a retreat to Taiwan in 1949 hauling gold, weapons and troops out of mainland China by plane and ship. Mao sought a reunified China and attempted to recapture Taiwan but with the advent of the Korean War the U.S. enacted a military blockade in the Taiwan Strait, and with relatively no navy of their own, the PRC was unable to pursue [Source](https://link-springer-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/book/10.1007%2F978-981-32-9675-6).

## Results
 To review; Manchuria is an industrial hub and allows for easy access to China proper, North Korea and China have a longstanding relationship, and China was under constant threat of U.S. Imperialism (not to mention the preceding century of abuse suffered by colonial and imperial powers beginning with the Opium Wars) leaves a newly founded and unstable country justifiably fearful and hostile to the U.S. But what was the last straw? Mao himself stated that should U.S. forces cross the 38th parallel, he will join the Korean War. He saw the crossing as an act of aggression and on October 7th he advised Kim Il Sung and Stalin that he would act, and on the 23rd of the same month he internationally declared war [Source](https://link-springer-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/book/10.1007%2F978-981-32-9675-6). The U.S. not only crossed the 38th parallel, but decimated the North Korean troops, pushing them to the Yalu River (demarcated on the map) lead by MacArthur, in an attempt to occupy North Korea. The PRC responded, sending troops through Manchuria to aid the North Koreans, and succeeded in pushing the U.S. lead forces back to the 38th parallel.

## Conclusion
Ostensibly, the PRC was left with little choice. Mao believed, justifiably given the preceding decades of U.S. antagonism and North Korean relations, that an American occupation was threat to National Security. Coupled with the KMT stronghold in Taiwan, effectively under U.S. protection, to the south, the PRC could not let a superpower remain near its borders. The Soviets remained comparatively uninvolved due to the nuclear threat posed by the Truman administration [Source](https://doi-org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/10.4324/9781315673288[Source].
