# The People's Republic of China in the Korean War: Why?
## Superpower Slugfest? I contend not.

Following the resolution of the Second World War, the United States of America and the Soviet Union were left head to head as the world's superpowers, both touting opposing ideology and so began the Cold War. How does China fit in? Well, China is currently well known as one of the strongest communist countries, and has become a superpower itself thus the simple connection is an idelogical one: in a war between communist North Korea and U.S.-backed capitalist South Korea, China's involvement seems self-explanatory. A simple look at the map to the right (or down, if on a phone) will show you the Korean Peninsula further compounds this.

I, however, argue that is not the case.
